For the last several weeks as I've been searching for a new job I have been surprised to find that not only is `React` a whole lot hotter than `Angular` where I am in Seattle, but it's honestly not even really close. I have spent the last 2.5 years on a weird little island [doing consulting work](https://www.fluencyy.com) where I could freely pick the tech stack for client projects and I tended to err on the side of what I knew best (i.e. `Angular`) so that my time wasn't spent fiddling around with a unfamiliar technology.


Now that I've come back from my blissfully unaware island, it really feels like my corner of the web development world (i.e. the somewhere-between-a-startup-and-a-small-company world) has more or less left `Angular` in the past and is significantly more focused on `React` and to a lesser extent `Vue`. I have only ever worked with these two technologies a tiny bit and I felt like if I wanted to stay sharp on what is in demand, I should get a bit more experience with `React` under my belt - so I decided to indulge a long time *I should really build a blog* feeling and...well, build a blog.


You are reading this on the blog that I built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), a framework for taking components written in `React`, filling them up with data sourced from a `GraphQL` layer that supports a really diverse set of data sources, and spitting out pre-rendered "static" content that is much friendlier for SEO in the same way that server rendered content is, and which can then be "re-hydrated" into a fully dynamic `React` application on the client - I think it's incredibly neat technology!

## Project objectives

There were a few goals I had with this project (besides the previously stated "build a blog in React"):

- Build it as an open source project which serves as a demo of how to build such a blog

  ðŸŽ‰ All source code for this blog can be found on my GitHub profile: [andrewbrey/console.blog](https://github.com/andrewbrey/console.blog)

- Incorporate `TailwindCSS` (and possibly `Tailwind UI`) which has quickly become my favorite way to build and style web content

- Build the `React` components in `TypeScript` instead of using `PropTypes` for type checking

  > Incidentally, I read a post on the React Native blog this week where there was discussion of moving the code base to using build-time type checking (presumably by moving to TypeScript?) rather than using run-time checking - does this imply PropTypes enforce run-time type safety? I need to look into this more...

- Get it hooked up to `Netlify` and `Netlify CMS` for builds, deploys, and content management

## Diving in to the details

As mentioned before, this whole project is [open source](https://github.com/andrewbrey/console.blog) and **MIT** licensed so feel free to skip this write up and dig in to the code if that's more your thing, but if you're interested in my color-commentary on the experience of building, read on!
