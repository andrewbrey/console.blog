Here it is, the first post of `console.blog`! This is a bit of an experiment for me to learn about:

- `React`
- `GatsbyJS`
- `Netlify & Netlify CMS`
- `prefers-color-scheme`
- **Whether or not the `<marquee>` element still works???**

and to have an excuse to use some shiny new components from [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) which, as of this
writing, is in early access. I don't know what this blog might become, and it is very _very_ possible that the eventual
answer is:

<marquee>
	<span class="text-xl text-indigo-700 dark:text-fluencyy-200">N o t h i n g</span>
</marquee>

> Sweet, looks like there's an answer for the `<marquee>` question--> **YES!** (well, as of _right now_, though the
> animation is very janky on my phone).

Anyway, **Hello World!**
