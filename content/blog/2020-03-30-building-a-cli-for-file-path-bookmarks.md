A while back I had been looking for a reason to play around with the [Open CLI Framework](https://oclif.io/) or `oclif` for short - it's a `nodejs` framework for building command line applications and it includes a lot of really nice things out of the box like support for single and multi-command CLIs.

When inspiration struck me in the form of a convenient method of "bookmarking" file paths in my terminal so that I can quickly jump between projects and important directories I decided to give it a go.

The result was an [open source](https://github.com/andrewbrey/file-path-bookmarks) `npm` package called [file-path-bookarks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-path-bookmarks) which lets you quickly and easily save bookmarks in your terminal! This is a short one but pretty much just wanted to say "hey, I tried this thing and it was pretty neat, I liked it, and I'll probably be using it again in the future!" so, anyway...

**Cheers!**
